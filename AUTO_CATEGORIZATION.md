# Auto-Categorization Dashboard - Admin Intelligence Hub

## Overview
The Admin Intelligence Hub (`/admin/page.tsx`) now features **automatic user categorization** that pulls all users from Firestore and intelligently organizes them by role in real-time. Admins can view, edit, and manage users with quick-action buttons directly from the dashboard.

### 2. **Course Enrollment Display**
For each user, the dashboard shows:

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
```
Page Load
    ↓
getUsersByRole("student") + getUsersByRole("teacher") + getAllCourses()
    ↓
Automatic Categorization (by role field)
    ↓
For each student: getAttendanceByStudent() + analyzeStudentAttendance()
    ↓
Display with risk badges + course badges + quick actions
```

### Key Functions

#### `loadDashboardData()`
```typescript
const loadDashboardData = async () => {
  // Pull all users and courses
  const [studentsData, teachersData, coursesData] = await Promise.all([
    getUsersByRole("student"),
    getUsersByRole("teacher"),
    getAllCourses(),
  ]);
  
  setStudents(studentsData);
  setTeachers(teachersData);
  setCourses(coursesData);
  
  // Calculate risk for all students
  await loadRiskAssessments(studentsData);
};
```

#### `handleQuickEdit(user: User)`
Opens modal to edit role and account status.

#### `handleEnrollCourses(student: User)`
Opens modal to manage course enrollments with checkboxes.

#### `handleDeleteUser(userId: string, userName: string)`
Deletes user after confirmation.

### Customization Options
You can modify:
- Number of users displayed per panel
- Which fields are shown in cards
- Quick action buttons available

## Security Considerations

### Role Changes
- Changing a user's role affects their access permissions
- Admin should verify change is intentional
- Warning displayed in edit modal

### Deletion Safety

- Cannot be undone
- Removes user from all courses

### Data Integrity
- Course enrollment updates both user and course records
- Automatic sync prevents inconsistencies
- Error handling for failed updates

## Performance

### Optimization Strategies
- Parallel data fetching with `Promise.all()`
- Risk calculations done in parallel per student
- Efficient Firestore queries (indexed by role)
- Client-side rendering for fast updates

### Load Times
Expected performance:
- Initial load: 2-3 seconds (with 50+ users)
- Quick edit: <1 second
- Course enrollment: 1-2 seconds
- Dashboard refresh: 2-3 seconds

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Users Not Appearing
**Check**:
1. User has correct `role` field in Firestore
2. User document exists in `users` collection
3. No console errors (check browser DevTools)

### Issue: Risk Badges Not Showing

1. User has `id` field
2. Firestore permissions allow updates
3. Valid role/status values selected
