- **Real-Time Updates**: Dashboard refreshes when data changes
- **Quick Edit Modal**: 
  - Change user role (student/teacher/admin)
  - Update account status (active/inactive/suspended)
  - Automatic re-categorization on save
- **Course Management**:
  - View enrolled courses for students
  - View teaching courses for teachers

  - Blue badges for student enrollments
  - Green badges for teacher assignments
  - Risk badges next to student names
  - Course count displays

### Risk Assessment System
- **Algorithm**: Multi-factor scoring (absence 60%, lateness 20%, trend 20%)
- **Risk Levels**: 
  - Low Risk: Score < 30 (Green badge) ✅
  - Medium Risk: Score 30-60 (Yellow badge) ⚠️
  - High Risk: Score > 60 (Red badge) 🚨
- **Metrics Tracked**:
  - Attendance percentage
  - Total absences and lateness count
  - Recent trend slope (improving/declining/stable)
  - Session count and patterns
