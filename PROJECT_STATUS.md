### Enhanced Database Collections for Academic Intelligence
- **Users**: name, email, role, identificationNumber, phoneNumber, accountStatus, dateJoined, academicHistory, department, enrolledCourses, riskAssessment, attendancePatterns, isEmailVerified
- **Classes**: courseCode, courseName, teacherId, schedule, enrolledStudents, attendanceThresholds, performanceMetrics
- **Attendance**: studentId, classId, date, status, timestamp, patterns, correlationData
- **Analytics**: userId, riskScore, attendancePercentage, trends, interventionHistory, predictionData

### Current EduTrack Architecture
- **Landing Portal** (`/`): Academic intelligence platform entry for Teachers/Students
- **Admin Intelligence Hub** (`/admin`): Hidden administrative control with predictive analytics
- **Teacher Analytics Dashboard** (`/teacher`): Class intelligence and student risk assessment
- **Student Success Portal** (`/student`): Personal academic analytics and progress tracking
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with academic institutional verification
- **Intelligence Database**: Firestore with real-time analytics processing

### Intelligence Features Framework
- **Pattern Recognition**: Statistical analysis foundation for attendance trends
- **Risk Assessment**: Threshold-based early warning system architecture
